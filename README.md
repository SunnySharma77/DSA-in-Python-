## Description
This repository contains a comprehensive collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) implemented in Python. It aims to provide a solid foundation for understanding core DSA concepts and improving problem-solving skills. Each implementation is designed to be clear and efficient, accompanied by explanations and example usage.

## Features

### Data Structures
Implementations of common data structures, including:
- Arrays
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly)
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees (Binary, Binary Search, AVL)
- Graphs (Adjacency List, Matrix)
- Hash Tables

### Algorithms
A variety of algorithms covering:
- Sorting (Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort)
- Searching (Binary Search, Linear Search)
- Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra's)
- Dynamic Programming (Knapsack, Fibonacci)
- Recursion and Backtracking
